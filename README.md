Morrowind Enchantment Simulator
====

Let's face it: the enchanting system in Morrowind is kind of a mess. This little tool should help give you an idea of how different variables affect enchanting and even allows you to tweak them to your liking.

I'd like to give a big thank you to the OpenMW team for untangling the enchantment code and making their project publicly available.
